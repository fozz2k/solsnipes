1. Create a list of historical memecoins/altcoins that have made at least a 100x from their starting price to their peak, 
while maintaining at least a 10x from their starting price to their peak.
2. Analyze healthy ranges of 24hvolume and liquidity to market cap.
3. Analyze healthy ranges of the number of holders
4. Create more datapoints to analyze from to make sure that coins are not rug pulls
Ideas: holders/Social Media followers, holders/Telegram member count, Liquidity Pool burned, etc.
We can use ChatGPT to help us come up with ideas. 
Ideally we have a machine learning model that is able to adjust these values meticulously through backtesting

Steps to do later down the line:
1. Implement computer vision (possibly with the use of OpenAI?) to track candle patterns of potential coins
2. Come up with an exit strategy. For instance, RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMAs, etc.
3. Backtest, backtest, backtest. Make sure our strategy is profitable
4. Connect solflare wallet and UniSwap
5. Run the bot with a low amount of money, (50$)? With 5$ buy-ins
